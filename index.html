        <h2>About Me and What I Can Do</h2>
        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>

        My name is Raymond Martinez and I have recently relocated to the San Diego area to become a Web Developer.  Prior to my move I was working as an Athletic Trainer for the San Francisco 49ers and lived in San Jose, California.

        </p>

        <p>
          
        Leaving my Sports Medicine career was not an easy decision but I ultimately decided to make a career change to chase my passion for creativity.  I have taken the time to learn how to code, utilizing Treehouse, FreeCodeAcademy, Codecademy and the Mozilla Developer Network to build my own websites.    

        </p>

        <p>

        Fairly recently, I decided to further my knowledge and overall expertise by enrolling in Thinkful's Full Stack Flex Bootcamp.

        <h3>What I do</h3>
        <p>

        I use the latest versions of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create user friendly websites.  

        </p>

        <p>

        I am currently learning, or will learn, React, Node & Postgres.

              I moved to San Diego over a year ago and was finally free to play as much golf as I could.  I decided to share each course I've played via this website.  It is a work in progress since I keep playing new courses.

              My friend is a personal trainer and is only marketing himself via flyers at coffee shops.  I built this for him if he ever feels the need to utilize the web.  Him and I are currently brainstorming for new ideas.  I may be revamping the look soon.

              I took a single lesson with Ed about six months ago and the way I found him was through a web search.  I noticed his current website needed some love so I took it upon myself to dress up the CSS.  His clients are usually the elder population so I kept it simple.
